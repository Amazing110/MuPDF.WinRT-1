ABOUT

MuPDF.WinRT is a lightweight PDF, XPS and CBZ viewer and parser/rendering WinRT component.

The MuPDF.WinRT is just wrapper under MuPDF library (http://www.mupdf.com/), 
so it can support the same functions as MuPDF library (if you could not find something - 
just create issue and I will add this.).
